# _Team Tracker, v.7_

_12 October 2020_

#### _Application for creating and storing data about teams_

#### By _**Brycen Bartolome and Vanessa Stewart**_

## Description

_This is a project for Epicodus to practice creating a Rails application with a one-to-many relationship. The original instructions include:_

Create an app to manage a league with teams and tournaments. You can decide what kind of league will be your client. Possible ideas include a sport of some sort: high school basketball, college foosball, bobsledding; a game of some sort: chess, board games, tiddlywinks, community laser tag; an activity of some sort - relay racing, ice sculpting, snail racing, country line dancing.

As the league manager, I want to add, update, delete and list teams.
As the league manager, I want each team to have a team coordinator so I have a single point of contact for that team.
As the team coordinator, I want to add, update, delete and list players on my team so I can keep track of who is currently on it.
Further Exploration
As the league manager, I want to set up games between teams so I can keep track of scores and win-loss records.
As the league manager, I want to generate a tournament that pits the top teams against each other based on their records. (Hint: Pick an even number like 8 or 16 so every team in the tournament always has a match.)
